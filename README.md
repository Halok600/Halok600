PRIYANSHU TIWARI 🤖⚡
========================
Turning logic into systems.
Turning math into intelligence.
Turning ideas into real, working products.


Currently obsessed with AI, ML, and DSA mastery.

🧠 About Me

• 4th Year B.Tech CSE Student
• Passionate about Artificial Intelligence & System Design
• Building projects where algorithms meet impact
• Grinding DSA like it’s a sport

I love solving problems that make me think:

“There has to be a smarter way to do this.”

💡 Leehint

An AI-powered coding assistant designed to help users solve problems with structured hints instead of direct answers.

✦ Provides multi-level hints that guide thinking without spoiling the solution.
✦ Encourages strong problem-solving habits and DSA intuition.
✦ Built to simulate how a good mentor nudges you toward the right approach.

Focus: Prompt engineering, structured reasoning flow, and intelligent hint generation.

Because learning > copy-pasting solutions.

🧪 Medical Image Fusion

A computer vision project focused on combining multiple medical images (e.g., MRI, CT) into a single enhanced image to improve diagnostic clarity and information richness.

✦ Applied image fusion techniques to preserve important features like edges, textures, and contrast from multiple modalities.
✦ Implemented pixel-level and transform-domain fusion strategies to enhance structural detail while minimizing noise.
✦ Focused on maintaining high spatial resolution and reducing information loss during merging.
✦ Evaluated results using metrics like entropy, PSNR, and structural similarity to ensure quality improvement.
✦ Designed preprocessing pipelines for normalization, alignment, and noise reduction before fusion.

Tools & Concepts: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Image Processing, Signal Processing, Edge Detection, Filtering Techniques

Built with the goal of enhancing visual interpretability for better clinical analysis.
